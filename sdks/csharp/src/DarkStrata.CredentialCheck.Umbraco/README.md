# DarkStrata Credential Check for Umbraco

Stops compromised credentials being used on your Umbraco site. When a member or
backoffice user logs in or sets a password, the email + password pair is hashed
locally and checked against the DarkStrata breach corpus using
[k-anonymity](https://github.com/darkstrata/darkstrata-sdks#how-k-anonymity-works):
only the first 5 characters of a SHA-256 hash ever leave your server. Passwords
are never sent to DarkStrata. That is the package's only interaction with the API.

Supports Umbraco 13 LTS, 15, 16 and 17 LTS. Server-side only, no backoffice UI.

## About DarkStrata

[DarkStrata](https://darkstrata.io) is a credential-intelligence service. We continuously
collect and parse infostealer logs and breach data from the clear, deep and dark web,
including Telegram channels, invite-only forums and paste sites, and match them against your
domains, employees and customers. Alerts arrive while a stolen credential is still fresh and
still revocable, and flow into the SIEM, SOAR and threat-intelligence tools you already run.

This package brings one part of that to Umbraco: the Credential Check API, which tells you
whether a specific email and password pair is known to be compromised, without the password
ever leaving your server.

## What it does

| Hook | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Password set / change / reset (members and backoffice users) | Rejected with identity error code `DarkStrataCompromised` when the email + password pair is in the breach corpus. |
| Member and backoffice login | Compromised pair is denied as a wrong password, counting towards Umbraco's lockout threshold (default), or allowed with a warning. A denied member login returns `CompromisedCredentialSignInResult` so you can say why. |
| Any hit | Publishes `CompromisedCredentialDetectedNotification` so you can run your own workflow. |
| Health check | Settings → Health Check → Security shows API key and connectivity status. |

## Install

```bash
dotnet add package DarkStrata.CredentialCheck.Umbraco
```

## Configure

### 1. Create an API key

In [app.darkstrata.io](https://app.darkstrata.io) go to **Integrations → API keys → Create key**
and tick the **`credential_check:read`** scope. Copy the key (it starts with `ds_live_`); it is
shown once. The scope is only offered on plans that include Credential Check, so if you cannot
select it, your plan needs upgrading first.

### 2. Give the key to the site

The package reads the standard ASP.NET Core configuration section `DarkStrata:CredentialCheck`,
so use whichever configuration source your hosting already uses. Pick **one**:

**Environment variable** (recommended for production, Umbraco Cloud, Azure App Service, Docker):

```
DarkStrata__CredentialCheck__ApiKey=ds_live_...
```

**User secrets** (local development, keeps the key out of git):

```bash
dotnet user-secrets set "DarkStrata:CredentialCheck:ApiKey" "ds_live_..."
```

**`appsettings.json`** (simplest, but the key is then committed with your site):

```json
{
  "DarkStrata": {
    "CredentialCheck": {
      "ApiKey": "ds_live_...",
      "ValidatePasswords": true,
      "CheckLogins": true,
      "LoginAction": "Deny",
      "FailOpen": true
    }
  }
}
```

Azure Key Vault, AWS Parameter Store and similar work through their normal configuration
providers; nothing package-specific is needed. Changes are picked up without a restart where
the provider supports reload.

### 3. Check it is working

Open **Settings → Health Check → Security** in the backoffice. **DarkStrata Credential Check**
is green when the key is configured and accepted by the API. It is red with a message when the
key is missing or rejected.

There is no backoffice settings screen for the key. It is a secret, so it lives in configuration,
not in the CMS database.

### What happens if the key is missing or wrong

| State | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| No key configured | One warning is logged at startup. Every check is skipped; logins and password changes behave as if the package were not installed. |
| Key rejected (401) or API unreachable | With `FailOpen: true` (default) the operation is allowed and a warning is logged. With `FailOpen: false` the login or password change is refused. |

### All settings

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `ApiKey` | - | Required. With no key every check is skipped and a warning is logged at startup. |
| `ValidatePasswords` | `true` | Reject compromised passwords when they are set or changed. |
| `CheckLogins` | `true` | Check member and backoffice logins. |
| `LoginAction` | `Deny` | `Deny` rejects the login like a wrong password (lockout rules apply). `Warn` allows it, logs a warning and publishes the notification. |
| `FailOpen` | `true` | If the DarkStrata API is unreachable, allow the operation. Set `false` to reject instead. |

## React to a hit (your workflow)

```csharp
using DarkStrata.CredentialCheck.Umbraco;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Composing;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.DependencyInjection;
using Umbraco.Cms.Core.Events;

public class CompromisedCredentialHandler : INotificationAsyncHandler<CompromisedCredentialDetectedNotification>
{
    public Task HandleAsync(CompromisedCredentialDetectedNotification n, CancellationToken ct)
    {
        // n.Source: MemberPassword | BackOfficePassword | MemberLogin | BackOfficeLogin
        // n.Email, n.UserId
        // e.g. email the security team, lock the member, open a ticket
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}

public class MyComposer : IComposer
{
    public void Compose(IUmbracoBuilder builder) =>
        builder.AddNotificationAsyncHandler<CompromisedCredentialDetectedNotification, CompromisedCredentialHandler>();
}
```

## Tell the person what happened

The checks correlate an email address **and** a password, so the accurate message is that the
*pair* is breached, not that the password is weak. Someone hitting this needs to change that
password everywhere they have reused it, so point them at password reset rather than just
refusing them.

**Password set or change.** The rejection is a normal `IdentityError` with code
`DarkStrataCompromised` (`DarkStrataOptions.IdentityErrorCode`), so substitute your own wording,
localised or not, wherever you render identity errors:

```csharp
foreach (var error in result.Errors)
{
    ModelState.AddModelError("", error.Code == DarkStrataOptions.IdentityErrorCode
        ? Localise("breachedCredentialPair")
        : error.Description);
}
```

**Member login.** Umbraco's built-in `UmbLoginController` always renders "Invalid username or
password" and gives you no way in, so use your own surface controller and check the result type:

```csharp
var result = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(model.Username, model.Password, model.RememberMe, true);

if (result is CompromisedCredentialSignInResult)
{
    ModelState.AddModelError("loginModel",
        "This email address and password have appeared together in a data breach. "
        + "Reset your password to sign in, and change it anywhere else you have used it.");
    return CurrentUmbracoPage();
}
```

`CompromisedCredentialSignInResult` is an ordinary failed `SignInResult`, so anything that only
looks at `Succeeded`, `IsLockedOut`, `IsNotAllowed` or `RequiresTwoFactor` keeps behaving exactly
as before. It only appears when `LoginAction` is `Deny`; `Warn` lets the login through.

**Backoffice login.** There is no equivalent hook. `IBackOfficeUserPasswordChecker` returns an
enum and the backoffice login screen's wording is fixed, so a denied backoffice login looks like
a wrong password. Use `CompromisedCredentialDetectedNotification` to alert someone out of band.

## Pause or uninstall

**Pause without uninstalling.** Remove or blank the API key. Every check is skipped, one
warning is logged at startup, and logins and password changes behave as if the package were
not installed. To switch off only part of it, set `CheckLogins` or `ValidatePasswords` to
`false`. Setting `LoginAction` to `Warn` keeps the checks running but stops them blocking
anyone, which is useful for a trial period.

**Uninstall.**

```bash
dotnet remove package DarkStrata.CredentialCheck.Umbraco
```

Rebuild and redeploy. The package writes nothing to the Umbraco database and adds no content
types, data types, tables or backoffice files, so there is nothing else to clean up. You can
delete the `DarkStrata` section from your configuration; it is harmless if left behind. If you
wrote a handler for `CompromisedCredentialDetectedNotification`, delete it too.
